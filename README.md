# Neuhub-in-the-Rough
These are Neuhub themes that require a developer or administrator with knowledge of HTML to modify. 

## What's the difference between Neuhub and Neuhub-in-the-Rough?

* Neuhub themes only need to be configured, and content is pulled from the database.
* Neuhub-in-the-Rough themes have features that need a developer to change.

For example, Neuhub-in-the-Rough themes might have static pages that a developer might need to change, since they cannot be changed through the Hubzilla interface. Or it might have a custom navigation bar that you need to edit so that it matches the content you are adding to your website.

## Why not build an interface so everything is database driven?

Mostly due to speed. Sometimes it is just faster to hard code certain elements into the website, especially if you are creating only one website with that particular design. And you may not want certain content editable through the Hubzilla interface.

And there are also situations where you might want to integrate code from another project or application into your Hubzilla website, which might need a custom solution.

## Compatibility

These themes are designed to be installed with Hubzilla, but they may (or may not) work on similar platforms, such as Streams.

If they require Neuheb to be installed, it will be mentioned in the theme's readme file. For example, some of these themes will use widgets that come with Neuhub.
